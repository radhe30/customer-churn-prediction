#Customer Churn Prediction â€“ Model Training & Analysis

This repository contains a complete pipeline to build and evaluate a machine learning model for predicting customer churn using the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). 
The goal is to help businesses proactively identify customers who are likely to leave and design retention strategies.

---

##Objective

Customer churn refers to customers discontinuing their subscription or ceasing to use a service. This project leverages historical customer data and machine learning to:

- Understand key factors driving churn.
- Train a predictive model using Random Forest.
- Evaluate model performance.
- Explain model decisions using SHAP values.
- Save the trained model for deployment or further analysis.

---------# Key Components #-----------

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview of data types and statistics
Class balance visualization
Correlation heatmap of numerical features

#Feature Engineering

New feature: AverageMonthlySpend = MonthlyCharges Ã— tenure
Binned tenure into categories (TenureCategory)

#Preprocessing

Handling missing values and converting datatypes
Encoding categorical variables (binary + one-hot)
Scaling numerical features with StandardScaler

#Modeling

Train-test split (80/20)
Random Forest Classifier used as the baseline model

Model evaluation using:
Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
Confusion Matrix visualization

#Model Explainability

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to visualize feature importance and understand model decisions.

#Model Saving

The trained model is saved as a .pkl file using joblib for later use.
